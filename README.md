This Java-based mobile application is created in Android Studio. It's specially developed for Persons with Disability in which they can apply for different applicable schemes.

# History
The ADIP Scheme has been in operation since 1981 with the main objective of assisting needy disabled persons in procuring durable, sophisticated, and scientifically manufactured, modern, standard aids and appliances that can promote their physical, social, and psychological rehabilitation by reducing the effects of disabilities and enhance their economic potential. Assistive devices are given to PwDs with the aim to improve their independent functioning and to arrest the extent of disability and occurrence of secondary disability. 

# Objective
We develop an app that gives a platform in which they can apply for different schemes in online mode with an easy GUI for these people. We also provide an option to choose the nearest agency from where they can get aid easily. We give them unique authentication by linking UDID(Unique disability ID) number.
